## Projects

#### Change Control Form and Workflow `2019`
Developed an approval form and workflow using Salesforce Lightning forms to improve an outdated change control process. Changes are entered into a form and a formula is calculated based on answers to user input in order to determine the impact of the change. The impact level determines the number of approvers needed for the change and all changes are tracked in Salesforce cases.

#### Cyber Alert Notification Workflow `2018`
Developed an automated workflow to handle cyber alerts using Microsoft Flow. This flow parses data generated in SIEM alerts to identify users, validates with the user the action that generated the alert, then sends the user's response to the security team for validation and finally, assists with the closing of the generated ticket. 

#### Metrics Automation `2018`
Automated the gathering, display, and analysis of cyber security and project management metrics. Data from over 30 sources were gathered using SQL, API's, and spreadsheet exports. ETLs, filters and additional queries were used to combine data sources and charts were displayed using Domo.
